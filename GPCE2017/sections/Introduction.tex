\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Over the years object-oriented programming has been widely used to offer great code reuse.
Programmers define classes as the signature that contains state and operations, and inheritance
achieves modularity and reusability. There have been lots of research problems proposed for
extensibility, of which the Expression Problem is a representative one. It requires both data variants
and operations to be defined in a modular and type-safe way. In terms of modularity, it means that users
can simply add new constructs or behaviours to an existing system, without modification on the existing code.

For that problem, some OO design patterns,
other approaches, even including the functional area, provide their solutions to that problem at various
aspects, and to some extent. For example, [independently extensible ...] has proposed several (partial) solutions with Scala code,
of which the object-oriented decomposition adopts the \textit{Interpreter} pattern for an extensible style.
